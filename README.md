# Tic_Tac_Toe

The command line and GUI versions of the ever lasting game Tic Tac Toe. The command line version currently
allows for playing against the computer, which has been implemented by using the random library in Python.
Not very exciting. It may be useful to use this script to learn how to apply Reinforcement learning, but
I'm not sure how feasible that is.

The GUI code uses the Python in-built library Tkinter. This creates a window that pops up as you run the code
and starts the game automatically, allowing for 2 player mode. Other features that are yet to be implemented are:
  1) playing against the computer
  2) Different pages in the window
  3) Button to reset the game
